No need to import vue directives or components.
We are using Vue 3 Script Setup with Typescript.
Dont import shadcn components, it will be automatically imported.
Only add comments if you are sure they are needed.
Use Lucide icons from 'lucide-vue-next' lib.

Use Tanstack Query (@tanstack/vue-query) for server state management.
Only use Pinia for client-side state that needs to be shared between components.
Never use Pinia for server state or API calls.
