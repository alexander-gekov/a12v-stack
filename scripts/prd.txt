# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Core table setup and data fetching
2. Basic row/column functionality
3. Selection and bulk actions
4. Context menus and filtering
5. View management and creation
6. Performance and accessibility

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- Performance with large datasets: Mitigate with virtualization
- Complex state management: Use composables effectively
- Mobile responsiveness: Design mobile-first
- Browser compatibility: Regular testing

## Resource Optimization
- Prioritize core functionality first
- Implement advanced features incrementally
- Focus on user-facing features early
- Regular performance monitoring

# Success Metrics
- Smooth performance with 1000+ items
- Sub-200ms response for common actions
- Full keyboard accessibility
- Mobile usability score > 90
